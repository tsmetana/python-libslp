PySLP: Python bindings for the OpenSLP API

SLP (Service Location Protocol) is a framework for the discovery and selection
of network services. The procol has been defined in the IETF RFC 2608. The API
implemented by OpenSLP is defined for the C programming language  by RFC 2614.

PySLP provides set of functions similar to those specified in the RFC 2614. Due
to the Python nature there are some divergences from the RFC definitions. Most
notably the functions never return an error code but raise a runtime exception
on SLP API call failures.  The SLPFree() function is not implemented in the
Python API at all for obvious reasons.
